<h2>General Study Information</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Hello, my name is <enumerator name>. I am a researcher for Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA), a research and policy non-profit that finds and promotes effective solutions to global poverty and other problems.</p>

<p>We are doing a research study on behalf of the World Bank.</p>

<h3>Why is this study being done?</h3>

<p>The purpose of this study is to understand how performance of school-going children is affected by the use of machine learning and AI in learning aids. We are inviting your child/you and your child to participate in this study because they are/is an elementary school student in Liberia.</p>

<p>Please note that our primary focus is on research, aiming to understand how the use of AI tools can improve children's performance in school. This study is not intended to provide aid or services but rather to gather valuable insights into these areas.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Voluntary Participation</h2>

<h3>Do I have to be in the study?</h3>

<p>You do not have to be in this study if you don't want to; it is completely voluntary. You will not be penalized in any way (or lose any benefits you currently receive) if you refuse to participate. During the interview, you can skip any question or stop participating at any time. After today, if you later decide you would like to withdraw your consent and stop participating in this study, you can do so by informing the research contact person listed at the end of this consent.</p>

<h3>Research Procedures</h3>

<h4>What is involved in this study?</h4>

<p>If you choose to participate in this study, we will ask you to complete a survey. This survey will take approximately 3 hours of your time. We will ask you questions about education information.</p>

<h4>If the study involves randomization or intervention:</h4>

<p>You also may be randomly assigned to one of three control groups for the study. </p>

<p>Random assignment to different groups in this study will be conducted by a computer (or other automated system) this means that nobody (not you or anyone on the research team) can affect your chances of being assigned to any group.</p>

<h4>If the participant will be asked to participate in more than one procedure:</h4>

<p>You will also be asked to complete a follow-up survey, where we will ask you questions about education information.</p>

<h4>If the study will involve follow-up data collections:</h4>

<p>We also plan to return in the future for some follow-up surveys/interviews.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Other Procedures</h3>

<h4>What else is involved in this study?</h4>

<p><strong>Audio- or video- recorded:</strong>
We would like to audio record today's survey to help us validate the quality of the data collected, for further analysis, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Collect GPS coordinates:</strong>
We would also like to record the GPS location of this survey to help us validate that we are collecting data in the right place for resource mapping and allocation in the region.</p>

<p><strong>Photograph participants:</strong>
We would also like to take photographs of participants in group discussions to be used for validating data from the field and presentations or publications about the study.</p>

<p><strong>Anthropometric measurements:</strong>
We would also like to measure your height/weight, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Biospecimen collection:</strong>
We also would like to collect/measure heart rate by putting an armband around your arm.</p>

<p>These audio recordings, GPS data, and photos will be securely destroyed after 5 years once they are no longer needed.</p>
