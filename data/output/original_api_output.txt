## General Study Information

### Introduction
Hello, my name is <enumerator name>. I am a researcher for Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA), a research and policy non-profit that finds and promotes effective solutions to global poverty and other problems.

We are doing a research study on behalf of the World Bank.

### Why is this study being done?
The purpose of this study is to understand how performance of school-going children is affected by the use of machine learning and AI in learning aids. We are inviting your child/you and your child to participate in this study because they are/is an elementary school student in Liberia.

Please note that our primary focus is on research, aiming to understand how the use of AI tools can improve children's performance in school. This study is not intended to provide aid or services but rather to gather valuable insights into these areas.
